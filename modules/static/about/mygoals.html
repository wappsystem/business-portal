                <b>Summary:</b>
                <br>A: Business data tracking or collection will become very easy and flexible if database tables and relations can be generated dynamically.
                <br>B: Business intelligence solutions in small and medium-sized enterprises are looks very complex. But if we have a detail
                look at the BI requirements, most of them are just some kind of data aggregations. With some simple tricks we can
                make most of the common work done in OLTP systems (in another word, no need for OLAP). The key concept is just to
                calculate the aggregation in a short period (say one day) when a data record is added, modified or deleted and save
                the small aggregation value into a database. After that we can calculate a big aggregation by adding the small one
                together. The conclusion is that we can just use standard SQL to query the database and get most common BI results
                in real-time. After years of effort and test I have implemented an application framework that integrates the data
                collection and data analysis together. This make me be able to setup a cloud based business portal system from scratch
                in a very short time.

                <b>My points of view:</b>
                <br>A: Data tables and relations should be created dynamically.
                <br>B: “Big data” can be treated as “Small data”

                    <td>Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter...  why are they so popular? One of the reasons is that all of them provide
                        some kind of information sharing. We have seen people post messages, photos, videos, audios and documents
                        for sharing. All of these information sharing has changed our life a lot.

                    <td>If we have a detail look at the

                        people to share structured information? Structured data are widely used in business. They are often stored
                        in a database and well shared inside an organisation. But it is not well or widely shared between
                        organisations across internet. If sharing some records in a database become relay easy and simple between
                        companies, the business collaborations will be more efficient. For example if a delivery service company
                        can access an online shop’s client address information and the online shop can access the delivery
                        company’s service status, the collaborations between them would be more efficient.

                        Business Date collection is the first step to manage a business because all decisions or
                        actions will depend on the data collected. Traditionally each staff in an organisation will
                        keep some records on papers or keep the records in private excel files. In order to make the
                        business more intelligent all data must be kept in a database so that the data can be accessed
                        and analysed when they are needed. Almost all staff in an organisation has no ideas about
                        the concept of database table. They usually say I want to keep records that should contain
                        fields like first name, last name, phone number etc.  Without the step of designing the
                        database table how can we keep the data into a database? With many years of effort and test
                        I have implemented a special technique that can easily create a data collection module
                        (using Html, JavaScript and CSS) on client side and automatically generate a database table
                        on server side. Here is an example:  <u data-m='20007128'>user interface</u> and
                        <a target=_blank href=/developer/M20007128>sources code</a>.

                    <td>All queries (SQL statements) are issued from client side.The challenge is that we must have very
                    easy and flexible ways to let data owner to control the permissions. Because the SQL statements are
                    sent from client side, we must have a mechanism that can prevent from running dangerous code on server side
                    </td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Data aggregation</td>
                    <td>Sub aggregation (small amount or records) values are calculated in real-time and the results are stored
                    into the database when transaction records are created, modified or deleted. So we do not need to scan all
                    transaction records when we need aggregation calculation across big time span (years or even total records).
                    <br>One principle is to reduce using OLAP system as much as possible and implement business intelligence function in OLTP system.
